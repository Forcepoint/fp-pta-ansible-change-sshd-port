# change-sshd-port

Change the default SSH port from 22 to whatever the ansible host is configured to use. 
Copied and modified with permission from https://dmsimard.com/2016/03/15/changing-the-ssh-port-with-ansible/
Modifications include running some of the commands with become, using the ansible_host variable instead
of inventory_hostname, and changing a when statement to fix a bug.
